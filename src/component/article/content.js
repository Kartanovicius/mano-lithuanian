      <h2 className={'text-green text-3xl font-bold'}>Japanese anime: here's why it works</h2>

      <p>
        Anime is made (and spoken) by native Japanese speakers... for native
        Japanese speakers. Meaning the language you hear is natural. However,
        you must remember that these are voice actors. Bear this in mind because
        if you just use anime to learn Japanese (we advise against this.: You
        may start sounding like an anime character! Watching and listening to
        Japanese anime helps you learn because it’s a form of language
        immersion. You’ll pick up vocabulary by listening to native Japanese
        speech. And your brain will work hard to understand the language using
        the words you know to figure out the meaning of words you don’t know.
        This is how you’re able to internalise language structures, which helps
        you learn Japanese. P.S. The context of the story will help you with
        this also. But before you get addicted to anime… dive into one of our
        Japanese courses to access video and audio clips of native Japanese
        speakers to get a flavour of spoken Japanese language.

      <p>Take this essential advice on how to learn Japanese from anime:</p>

      <h3 className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>1. Watch with (or/and without) Japanese subtitles.</h3>
      <p>
        This helps immerse you in Japanese. DO NOT watch with subtitles in your
        native language as this will distract you from learning Japanese.
      </p>
      <h3 className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>2. Switch on: listen actively, not passively.</h3>
      <p>
        Actively listen to the language. Zoning out, having a glass of wine or
        playing on your phone… These won’t help you learn Japanese. Sorry.
      </p>
      <h3 className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>3. Start with ‘slice-of-life’ anime.</h3>
      <p>
        Watching crazy action scenes and supernatural narratives might be a
        little distracting… Start with ‘slice of life’ anime because these
        depict the ordinary lives of everyday people and use simple language
        that you’re likely to use in Japan.
      </p>
      <h3 className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>4. Re-watch the same episode again:</h3>
      <p>
        Keep concentrating and see what new words you can pick up this time.
        Feeling creative? Read our blog on Japanese Kanji and see how many you
        recognise from the Japanese subtitles.
      </p>
      <h3 className={'text-2xl font-semibold'}>5. Love watching anime!</h3>
      <p>
        Doing something you enjoy in another language is a great way to immerse
        yourself in that language. So if you like watching TV and anime in
        particular (see some suggestions below if you’re new), that’s great!
